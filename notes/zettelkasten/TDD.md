# TDD: The 20% That Brings 80% of the Benefits

The TDD is 

## 1. The Red/Green/Refactor Cycle

- **Red**: Write a failing test first. This test expresses the behavior you want, but it should fail because the functionality doesn’t exist yet.  
- **Green**: Implement the simplest code to make the test pass. Do not over-engineer; just get it passing.  
- **Refactor**: Once the test is green, clean up the code (and tests if needed) without breaking existing functionality.

Why is this in the “20%”?  
It disciplines your development in tight, safe iterations. You always have a failing test guiding the next implementation, then you refactor with confidence after the test goes green.

## 2. Test the Essential Behaviors

- **Focus on critical paths**: For instance, the “happy path” and the key failure conditions that matter most in your domain.
- **Avoid over-testing**: You do not need to test every tiny implementation detail unless it is crucial to your business rules.

Why is this in the “20%”?  
Most bugs (80%) come from core business logic or critical flows. By focusing on these, you cover the highest risk with minimal effort.

## 3. The Arrange, Act, Assert Pattern

Structure your tests in three distinct parts:

1. **Arrange**: Set up the objects, variables, or data you need.  
2. **Act**: Execute the method or action under test.  
3. **Assert**: Verify the results match your expectation.

Why is this in the “20%”?
It keeps tests organized and easy to read. You can quickly see what’s being set up, what’s being executed, and what outcome is expected.

```ruby
# Example in [[RSpec]]

it "creates a new user successfully" do
  # Arrange
  user_params = { email: "test@example.com", password: "123456" }
  
  # Act
  user = User.create(user_params)
  
  # Assert
  expect(user).to be_valid
  expect(User.count).to eq(1)
end
```

Why is this in the “20%”?
It keeps tests organized and easy to read. You can quickly see what’s being set up, what’s being executed, and what outcome is expected.
# 4. Keep Tests Simple and Fast
- **Simplicity**: Avoid complex logic in your tests. Each test should cover a small, specific behavior.  
- **Speed**: Use mocks or stubs for external services to prevent slow network/database calls. Quick tests encourage frequent runs.  
- **Isolation**: One failing test should clearly indicate the cause. If multiple tests break for one issue, the tests are too interdependent.

Why is this in the “20%”?
If tests are slow or overly complex, teams avoid running them often. Quick feedback is a core benefit of TDD.

# 5. Focus on Critical Coverage (Avoid Chasing 100%)
- **Cover main business rules** thoroughly.  
- **Validate error handling** (it’s a common source of production bugs).  
- **100% coverage** is often not worth the diminishing returns. A solid 80-90% on crucial areas is more effective.

Why is this in the “20%”?
Not all code carries equal risk. Concentrate your testing effort where failures would be most costly or most likely.

Embracing these practices ensures a robust test suite, giving you confidence to refactor and evolve your code with minimal regressions.

# Conclusion
By applying these five key points—the “20%” of TDD—you’ll gain 80% of the benefits:

1. Red/Green/Refactor for iterative, safe development.  
2. Test crucial scenarios rather than every detail.  
3. Use Arrange, Act, Assert to structure your tests clearly.  
4. Keep tests fast and straightforward for frequent feedback.  
5. Aim for solid coverage on critical code paths without obsessing over 100%.

Embracing these practices ensures a robust test suite, giving you confidence to refactor and evolve your code with minimal regressions.
