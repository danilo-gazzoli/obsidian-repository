[[Interpreted Language]]s can be face performance issues when the application become a big project with too many users and requests. However existing ways to get around this issues.

## **1. [[Optimizing Database Queries]]**

- Use **database indexes** to speed up queries.
- Write **custom SQL** for complex queries that can't be efficiently handled by [[ORM]]'s used by language.
- Use **database replication** for scaling reads.
- Implement **caching strategies** to reduce the load on the database.

## **2.[[Caching]]**

- **Page caching**: Entire HTML pages are cached to avoid rendering them repeatedly.
- **Fragment caching**: Individual sections of the page, like a user profile, can be cached and reused across requests.
- **Low-level caching**: Data that doesnâ€™t change frequently (like user settings or product listings) is stored in fast-memory caches like **Redis** or **Memcached**.

## **3. [[Asynchronous Processing]]**

- Companies like **GitHub** use background job frameworks like **Sidekiq** to move time-consuming tasks (like sending emails or processing payments) off the main request cycle, allowing the app to remain responsive.
- Tasks are queued and processed asynchronously, improving the scalability of the app and keeping the user experience smooth.

## **4. [[Horizontal Scaling]] and [[Load Balancing]]**

- Large systems like **Shopify** and **GitHub** use **horizontal scaling** to handle high traffic. This means they deploy **multiple instances** of their application across **several servers**.
- These instances are managed by a **load balancer**, which distributes incoming traffic evenly. This way, they avoid overloading any single server.
- Additionally, Ruby on Rails apps are often containerized (using **Docker**), making it easier to manage these instances across multiple machines.

## **5. [[Microservices]] and [[Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)]]**


- Instead of relying entirely on a monolithic architecture, many large companies break down their applications into **microservices**. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and communicates with others via APIs.
- For example, **Shopify** uses microservices to separate their payment processing, user management, and order systems. This approach makes it easier to scale individual parts of the system independently and handle more load.
- Although these microservices may still use Ruby on Rails for specific tasks, they can be written in other languages if needed for performance reasons (for example, **Go** for performance-heavy services).


## **6. Using [[CDN]] and [[Edge Caching]]**

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** are used to cache static content (like images, JavaScript, and CSS files) at locations closer to the user.
- Companies like **Airbnb** and **GitHub** use **edge caching** to ensure that static assets are served quickly to users worldwide. This reduces the load on their Rails app, especially for media-heavy sites.
